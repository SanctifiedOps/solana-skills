## Two Perspectives

**For Projects (Building Trust)**:
- `legitimacy-signals` - What makes you look legitimate
- `transparency-and-disclosures` - How to communicate honestly

**For Buyers (Verifying Trust)**:
- `rug-detection-checklist` - How to spot scams
- `legitimacy-signals` - What to look for in good projects

## Quick Start

**Build trust as a project:**
```
Use legitimacy-signals to draft the transparency page
for a new memecoin. Include address registry, authority
disclosures, and risk statements.
```

**Verify a token as a buyer:**
```
Apply rug-detection-checklist to analyze [MINT_ADDRESS].
Check authorities, LP status, holder distribution, and
creator wallet history.
```

## Key Principle

**Verify, don't trust.**

Every claim must be checkable on-chain. This pillar teaches both:
- How projects can demonstrate legitimacy
- How buyers can verify claims
